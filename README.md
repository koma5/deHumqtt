# deHumqtt
mqtt enabled mini peltier dehumidifier.
The very cheap dehumidifier *ETD250* got stuffed with an Arduino Ethernet.
The control over the the two LED, the fan und the peltier element took the Arduino with an relay.
Also the two switches (tank full, tank insterted) became inputs for the Arduino.
